    [0]: Not available in sx
    [1]: `hx showtx` is always using JSON output,
         `-j` and `--json` are ignored.
    [2]: The compatibility has been checked with electrum and with `sx`.
         However if your `sx mpk` returns a hex representation of `64` digits,
         then you *miss* half of it.
         Moreover subsequent commands (genpub/genaddr) might behave
         non-deterministically.
         Finally they have different names:
           mpk     -> electrum-mpk
           genpub  -> electrum-pub
           genpriv -> electrum-priv
           genaddr -> electrum-addr
         The commands electrum-seq and electrum-stretch-seed expose
         the inner workings of the key derivation process.
    [3]: Rounding is done upward in `hx` and downard in `sx`.
         So they agree `btc 1.4` and `btc 1.9` but on `btc 1.5`,
         `hx` returns `0.00000002` and `sx` returns `0.00000001`.
    [4]: The `ripemd-hash` command is taking raw-bytes as input,
         while the other hashing commands are taking hexadecimal encoded inputs.
         This is for this reason that `hash160` has been added
         (`hx ripemd-hash` is equivalent to `hx encode-hex | hx hash160`
         and `hx hash160` is equivalent to `hx decode-hex | hx ripemd-hash`).
